## Goal

Our goal is to prove the correctness of the execution of a batch of transactions can be proved.

To illustrate the process of building a state machine like the EVM, whose execution correctness can be proved, 
we need to explain the process of arithmetization o 

 arithmetize the execution of EVM transactions so that


The previous program written in an assembly language that is
read by a program called "the executor".
The executior generates an execution trace according to each instruction of 
the assembly program.
