Welcome to Polygon zkEVM documentation.

We emphasise that this documentation is still Work In Progress (WIP). Some aspects have been covered in more detail, while others still need further expansion. Also, sections of this documentation might later be reorganized in order to achieve better flow.

This section will explain how the prover works, which are the cryptographic tools used and so on. However, this document is still in the TODO list.
